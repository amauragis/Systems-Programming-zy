czy and dzy were tested against each other (ie, the output czy was piped into
dzy).  This test was repeated with files causing the following circumstances:
	- File size smaller than 16 (smaller than dictionary)
	- File size smaller than 16 with repeated characters
	- File size smaller than bit writing buffer
	- File size larger than bit writing buffer

Sample files included arbitrarily generated character files, long code files,
and some binary files.

Additionally, a file compressed with my czy program was decoded by another
students dzy program, and vice versa.

Compression ratios were measured using randomly generated files and constant
character files (ie: /dev/zero) of various sizes.

During the design process, files were generated and inspected by hand.

Currently czy and dzy passed all tests that were run.
